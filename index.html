      in and save those need to escape the base. That was merely a
      diversion. (Second Crunch) They had been hiding in the hero's home

      <h2>Showcase</h2>
      <p>Here's a glimpse of what the game looks like so far.</p>

    <h2>Artwork and Concepts</h2>
        <p>Here is some early artwork showcasing the initial concepts
        and designs that were thought out. The idea of the style have
        some some colorful and cartoon comic touch. Floragons are alien
        based plants and Goozite are clone monsters by Floragons, these
        are some rough idea for enemies in the game. Weapons and Gear
        you see currently in-game or screenshots (12-29-24) are just
        mock ups in concept. The Hero name and design has changed lot.
        He was formerly look like a cornflake, but I feared his design
        would break easily into crumbs, so he became a strong tough cool
        waffle. He initially had more lines but later adjusted the
        design due to confusion with his appearance. After numerous
        revisions, this is main concept of now. He is mainly now called
        The Waffle Crusader since acts more like hero and all. When
        gallxy calls he is there to save the day. - ZNukem</p>

    <section id="about">
      <h2>What Is Freedom Scoops</h2>
      <p>It is open source video game inspired from the mid 1990's
      cereal game <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Chex_Quest"
      target="_blank" style="color: #ff66ff;">Chex (C) Quest</a> food
      game, which was made on a ID Software <a
      href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_engine" target="_blank"
      style="color: #ff66ff;">DOOM Engine</a>, Based on a modified Final
      Doom source code. This project acts like data replacement similar
      as <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Freedoom" target="_blank"
      style="color: #ff66ff;">Freedoom</a>. But has a very different
      scope has no relation to the original Chex (C) Quest game and it’s
      completely independent as its own unique creation. Speaking of
      Freedoom we forked the game and tools for the project. Pretty
      cool, right? All you need to know about a Asset Replacement or <a
      href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Total_conversion" target="_blank"
      style="color: #ff66ff;">Total Conversion</a> if want to call it
      that. It’s a collection of entirely original, handcrafted game
      resources that replace existing assets to create a brand-new game.
      These resources are then compiled into a game data file (commonly
      referred to as a WAD in DOOM terms). Which can be run on any
      DOOM-compatible engine or port. Thanks to the open-source nature
      of the <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_source_code"
      target="_blank" style="color: #ff66ff;"> DOOM source code</a>, we
      can freely build and customize everything we need to bring this
      project to life. This helps us making our own new game at same
      time.</p>
  
  <section id="about">
 <h2>Freedom Scoops History</h2>
      <p>Everything you need to know about Freedom Scoops history began
      as an early backstory to Luke Ken's origin tale, one of my other
      game projects, in mid-August 2023 one morning, and grew into
      something larger as a sub-verse spin-off idea.</p>

      <p>One day around September 20 2023 on the Freedoom Discord after
      there was a brief conversation about Chex Quest by Dari. Right
      after. I went on and pitched the idea doing a the concept of a
      free cereal iwad. Some responded positively, My friend Fraggle
      really like the idea.</p>
      
      <p>Same day started up project repo the project was initially
      called "Freedom Flakes", I didn't know there was old meme shared
      same name until later on. In March 1st 2024 But I renamed it to
      "Freedom Scoops" accommodate future proofing with changing like
      character and designs. "Scoops" reflects the idea of a bowl of
      cereal, and "Freedom" represents its free, open-source nature. The
      project is part of the Luke Ken universe but in a sub-verse,
      hosted within the same discord community.</p> 

      <p>I began developing the game mainly just as a hobby project,
      creating assets and an intro fanfare track for game, also receive
      few contributions like placeholder music from Dari. However, later
      on have some technical issues with the original repository
      (including problems with commit system) forced me to redirect the
      project to a new repository, and the old one was archived. Started
      to release all later changes into new repository added the split
      into two part mini iwads FS1 First and Second Crunch with all
      resources even writen the story and some basic concepts.</p>  
      
      <p>Despite facing challenges, Freedom Scoops has continued to
      evolve, growing beyond its Chex Quest Itself. It remains free and
      open-source, and I'm still working on expanding it as I go,
      allowing it to develop into something unique. - ZNukem</p>
